= WHAT?

Plain simple (-mostly- partially) (stolen) bindings for libcurl.

= WHY?

'Cause I want to. And other bindings have stuff I do not need/want/agree.

= WHO'S TO BLAME?

* "typhoeus":http://github.com/pauldix/typhoeus
* "curb":http://github.com/taf2/curb

I've pillage'd and plunder'd (tm) both. AND HERE WE ARE!

= REALLY?

Yes. I've used Net::HTTP for over a billion requests (literally) and now it's
time to take it up a notch. libcurl is a very mature, stable and well tested project.
ruby-curl is here to fetch the next billion requests.

= SERIOUSLY!

Thanks Todd Fisher and Paul Dix for the -code- inspiration. Seriously.
